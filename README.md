# Resturant Menu
This restaurant menu website was developed using a combination of React for the front end and Node Express for the backend. The site provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to browse through the various menu items at the restaurant, which are organized into 4 categories : plates, sandwiches, drinks, and shisha.
